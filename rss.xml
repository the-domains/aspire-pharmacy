            <title><![CDATA[Hello. My name is Hany Biskaly. By the coat, you can probably tell I’m a pharmacist, a key member of your health-care team. You may not know this but as a pharmacist, I have more training in medication therapy than any other heath-care provider in Canada, including your family doctor. That qualifies me to make sure your medications are appropriate for you. More than that, I can ensure your dosage is right and that there are no conflicts with other medications.Did you know I can, where appropriate, renew your medication or even prescribe new medications? All with your consent, of course, and your doctor is always informed.I am also uniquely qualified with specialized training to help you quit smoking, deal with diabetes and help you with lifestyle changes that will give you a longer, happier and healthier life. In fact, I can help you develop a personalized health-care plan that may well lessen your dependence on the medications you are currently taking.I am always welcoming new patients. And the first consultation is FREE. Why not give me a call today at 613-680-5560 to set up an appointment? Or, you can book a your consultation online right now!]]></title>
